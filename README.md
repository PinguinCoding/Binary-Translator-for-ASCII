# Binary-Translator-for-ASCII
This is a simple project that consists of a single class capable of transforming a binary sequence into ASCII text, going through a process of transforming it first into hexadecimal, followed by decimal and finally into a final string

### Purpose
The main motivator of this project was to practice manipulation of hash map data structure as well as apply the use of test units through pytest, it also served as a way to study more about different types of numerical representation with binary, decimal and hexadecimal bases.

## Operation
Due to the simplicity of the proposal, no efficient data collection structure or a more functional class has been created, only the core of the class is well defined and its functionality is limited since it is only able to represent ASCII characters that are not special in any way. The input can only be done through binary code and the code return all possible formats of conversion as a way of demonstrating its use.
